#   For a long time, event analysis and prediction techniques are major focuses in data-driven knowledge learning studies. They support downstream tasks such as question answering, intention understanding, and risk monitoring, and have wide application prospects in domains such as security, financial, and law. Events are nested via subevent relations, which forms different granularity levels. Individual behaviors, country actions and natural disasters are all described via events in different granularity levels. Based on this insight of events, this research proposes the concept of composite event, which is composed via several subevents. In addition, the subevents can also be composite events. Based on the three main stages, i.e., composite event acquisition, storyline generation, and prediction, this research includes: (1)  the problem of cross-granularity event connection in the stage of event acquisition; (2) the problem of event importance measurement in the stage of event storyline generation; and (3) the problem of modeling event effects in the stage of event prediction. This research provides new problems and solutions based on existing studies. The result may promote the event analysis and prediction techniques in industry, and is of great importance to both research and application.
